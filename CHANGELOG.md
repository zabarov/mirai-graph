  - evidence/provenance;
  - governance;
  - conformance levels;
  - context-pack generation;
  - profiles;
  - test-suite direction.
- JSON schemas for:

- Synthetic context-reduction benchmark.
- Initial adoption guide.
- Contribution guide.
- Practice-and-science program note.
- Initial `$graph` skill to GrowGraph transfer map.

  public GrowGraph.
- Public graph DNA, graph seed and graph embryo standard sections.
- Graph seed and graph embryo schemas.
- Minimal graph seed example.
- Seed preview command that emits a deterministic graph embryo.
- Alpha readiness score command.
- Benchmark script `--write` output mode.
- Measure-convert-optimize public benchmark protocol.
- Initial profile manifests.
- Context-pack and profile schemas.
- Negative validation fixtures.
- Context-pack generator alpha command.
- Profile validation command.
- Independent implementation pilot plan.
- Semantic completeness review protocol.
- Release check script.

### Validation

- `npm test` validates the minimal graph package.
- `npm test` validates the synthetic benchmark graph package.
- `npm test` reproduces the synthetic context-reduction calculation:
  `56.4516%`.

### Limitations

- The standard is an early draft.
- The benchmark is synthetic and supports method inspection only.
- There is not yet an independent implementation pilot.
- Context-pack generation is documented but not yet automated.
